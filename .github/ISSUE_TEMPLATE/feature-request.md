**AS** a player/administrator/etc.
**I WANT** a feature
**SO THAT** I can be satisfied with my Minecrafting experience

### Proposed Criteria
- Option `minecraft.satisfaction` is in the config.yml
- Option defaults to true
- When `minecraft.satisfaction` is set to true, all players on my server receive the `Hero of the village` effect.
